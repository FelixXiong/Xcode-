# Xcode Error Collection



On the way to development, you will always encounter various kinds of errors. There are swift and Xcode.
In the future development, it is convenient to look through the search for answers.

# What it is

As a college student who started iOS development and has more ideas,

At present, self-study development will encounter various kinds of errors in the process of developing the functions. When solving problems, it is necessary to find suitable links in the network.

At present, almost all the same problems exist on major platforms that already exist and will be incorporated in this book.

After solving some problems, we can consider collecting them. Not only can we have a lot of sense of accomplishment when we look back, we can also help more developers who have encountered this problem, and hope that you can all walk on the road to development. Some detours.

# Process

At first it was to make a reminder list of the errors he had encountered. I think there are many developers, problems encountered in the past, and pits that have been stamped on them.

At the same time, because each person's output has a different platform, he wants to create a Repo on GitHub to collect and organize.

This is currently included in the Repository, except I wrote it myself.

There are also some friends who are learning Swif and making independent development.

# content

The contents of this collection mainly include two parts

## No response

No response to operation: The location, problems, and solutions to occur when the operation is not responding.
Currently only Storyboard.

## Xcode Error Codes

The Xcode error code includes the error code that appears when the error code of the **Swift compiler** and the **console** is wrong and the solution.

At present, according to the increase in the number of reported errors, it has gradually increased.

# Expectations

> Having encountered a problem, first look at the collection for any such errors.
>
> When you encounter errors, don't panic and don't be discouraged. You're not alone.

## Hope to have your contribution

First of all if you are an iOS developer or will be, then this error collection can help you save time in solving problems.

If you are interested in learning about the Xcode error specification and are familiar with and follow the specifications explicitly mentioned in the book, I hope you join together.

Hopefully this error collection can have more developers involved, and also welcome friends who are interested to share.

Welcome to Watch, Star, Fork, and most importantly Pull Request: Contribution errors and solutions.
